        <bioghist>
            <p> Born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1887, Sylvia Beach was the second of three daughters
                of Eleanor Orbison Beach and the Reverend Sylvester Woodbridge Beach (Princeton
                Class of 1876), a pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Princeton. She is best
                known for running the bookstore and lending library Shakespeare &amp; Company and
                for publishing James Joyce's <emph render="italic">Ulysses</emph> . </p>
            <p> With the help of Adrienne Monnier, owner of the bookshop La Maison des Amis des
                Livres, Beach opened Shakespeare &amp; Company at at 8, Rue Dupuytren in Paris in
                1919 as a bookshop, lending library, and occasional publisher specializing in
                English and American literature. In 1922 the shop moved to 12, Rue de l'Odéon,
                across the street from Monnier's establishment, where it remained until its closing
                in 1940. During two decades, Shakespeare &amp; Company served as a meeting point for
                expatriate writers and American visitors to Paris. Beach was interned for six months
                during World War II, but although she managed to keep her inventory hidden in a
                vacant apartment nearby, she did not re-open the shop after the war. </p>
            <p> Sylvia Beach chronicled her experiences with Shakespeare &amp; Company and life in
                Paris between the wars in a memoir of the same title, <emph render="italic">Shakespeare and Company</emph> , which was published in 1956. Towards the end
                of her life, she was widely honored for her publication of <emph render="italic">Ulysses</emph> and her support of aspiring writers during the 1920s. She
                remained in Paris until her death in 1962. Her ashes were buried in the Beach family
                plot in Princeton, NJ. </p>

                        interfiled. </p>

                        Anderson, Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, Robert McAlmon, James Joyce, T.

                        Moore, Katherine Anne Porter, Richard Wright, George Antheil, Harriet
                        Weaver, Gordon Craig, Arthur Symons, Ford Madox Ford, Frank Harris, Norman

                    <p> The Shakespeare &amp; Company series documents Sylvia Beach's business
                        activities relating to her bookshop in Paris. It includes information on
                        bookshop inventory, orders and subscriptions, the lending library,
                        publishing activities, author readings, bookshop exhibits, and the sale of
                        rare books and manuscripts. Of special interest is the material relating to
                        Beach's publication of James Joyce, including, in 1922, Joyce's <emph render="italic">Ulysses</emph> , which she distributed as long as it
                        remained a banned book in England and the United States. The series also
                        includes files relating to the publication of Joyce's <emph render="italic">Pomes Penyeach</emph> in 1927 and a volume of studies of Joyce's <emph render="italic">Work in Progress</emph> (later incorporated in <emph render="italic">Finnegans Wake</emph> ) by fourteen contributors,
                        entitled <emph render="italic"> Our Exagmination Round His Factification for
                            Incamination of Work in Progress </emph> . </p>

                                        type was entirely reset and the text, consequently, expanded
                                        to 735 pages. In this reset printing most of the "Additional
                                        Corrections" of the 4th-7th printings were incorporated into
                                        the text. </p>

                                        of the 8th printing, but these proofs would seem to indicate
                                        that there were a few new corrections for the 9th (something

                    <p> Sylvia Beach's Circle and Collections consists of items collected by Sylvia
                        Beach, documenting two overlapping collecting activities: Sylvia Beach's
                        incidental files on artists in her circle (not directly relating to her
                        publication activities, which are documented in the Shakespeare &amp;
                        Company series), and her more formal literary and art collections. The
                        boundary between the two collection activities is fluid, and there are
                        several documented cases in which Beach later formalized collections that
                        were originally created out of personal interest or for reference or
                        business purposes (most notably, her collection of Joyce material, which she
                        largely sold to the University of Buffalo, and her collection of Whitman
                        manuscripts, originally keepsakes she inherited from her aunt and which she
                        later exhibited and offered for sale). The series further contains
                        information on exhibitions of Beach's collections and on the sale of
                        collection items to various cultural institutions. </p>
                    <p> Due to some overlap between Beach's collecting activities and the
                        publications and exhibitions conducted at Shakespeare &amp; Company,
                        researchers are advised that the Shakespeare &amp; Company series may
                        contain additional material Beach would have considered a part of her
                        collection. </p>
                    <p> While a number of James Joyce items are represented here, researchers may be
                        interested to know that Sylvia Beach sold the better part of her Joyce
                        collection, including manuscripts and correspondence, to the University of
                        Buffalo Library in 1959, where it is available for research. </p>

                    <p> This series consists of assorted photographs documenting the different
                        facets and relationships central to Beach's life: her family; her friends,
                        particularly Adrienne Monnier, but also including writers and artists; and
                        her life in Paris as proprietress of Shakespeare and Company. </p>
                    <p> Snapshot images and negatives (here defined as photographs lacking the
                        formal approach of a studio portrait or news agency documentary photograph)
                        measuring approximately 2.75 x 3.75 inches (7 x 10 centimeters) can often be
                        attributed to Sylvia Beach herself. Images taken in and around Shakespeare
                        and Company and Les Déserts are particular candidates for this attribution.
                        However, photographer attributions were not given in this finding aid unless
                        explicitly stated. Researchers should contact the estates of Man Ray, Gisèle
                        Freund, Berenice Abbott and other copyrighted photographers present in the
                        collection for information regarding copyrighted photographs. </p>

                        <p> This subseries consists of images of Sylvia Beach and her life in Paris
                            from just before the founding of Shakespeare and Company until her

                        <p> This subseries consists of personal photographs of Sylvia Beach and
                            Adrienne Monnier and their family members taken over the course of their
                            long companionship. These images are distinct from images taken by and
                            of Sylvia Beach and Adrienne Monnier that concern their professional
                            lives in Paris, which are located elsewhere in the collection. The
                            subseries includes images of James Joyce and Sylvester Beach in the
                            personal context of family gatherings. </p>

                                "portrait d'Adrienne Monnier par Eyre de Lanux" on the back. A
                                notation of the other side of the board, facing the back of the
                                print, reads "femme Marie." A drawing of Marie (Rinette) Monnier was
                                included in de Lanux's 1921 New York exhibition of "Outlines of
                                Women." </p>

                                <p> Dates and locations recorded on prints in this folder appear to
                                    conflict, and thus the range of dates 1923-1924 has been applied
                                    to all prints even when a date is recorded on the print itself.
                                    The locations (Ronda and Pamplona, Spain) also conflict, even
                                    when recorded on the print. Researchers are cautioned to confirm
                                    both date and locations of images. </p>

                                    <p> Sylvia Beach apparently masked the original inscribed
                                        photograph, eclipsing the hand written inscription on the
                                        lower-right corner, and then re-photographed the image,
                                        resulting in these copy negatives. Presumably it was one of
                                        these two negatives that produced the enlarged (masked)
                                        print also located in this folder, which was again inscribed

                                        related image of Hemingway outside Shakespeare and Company
                                        with Sylvia Beach and her shop assistants. The retouching
                                        surrounds the line Hemingway drew on the original. This
                                        print is inscribed "To Sylvia with love, farewell to face
                                        wounds (from any source!)—Ernest Hemingway" </p>

                                    W1— Dear Sylvia Beach, You flattered me by asking for my
                                    portrait, so here it is by the grace of a street camera artist.
                                    It’s pretty awful, but I’m afraid that it is a good resemblance!
                                    It was good to see you again, and I shall hope for another visit
                                    next year.—Sincerely, B.W. Huebsch" A second very small image is
                                    of this photograph framed and on a floor, cut from a larger

                                    Piston, Herbert Elwell and Aaron Copland. April or May 1926 in
                                    apartment of Nadia Boulanger. Occasion was a concert of The
                                    Société Musicale Indépendente about to be held at Salle Gaveau.
                                    ‘For all of us the concert constituted something of a debut,
                                    since all our works were sizeable and I think none of us had
                                    ever had works of that seriousness and length performed before.
                                    A fifth composer, George Antheil, was also on the program, but
                                    was unable to be present for the photograph.’ (From letter from
                                    Virgil Thomson, 2/18/59), Taken by Thérèse Bonney" </p>
                                <p>Photo was likely taken May 5, 1926, the day before the
                                    concert.</p>
